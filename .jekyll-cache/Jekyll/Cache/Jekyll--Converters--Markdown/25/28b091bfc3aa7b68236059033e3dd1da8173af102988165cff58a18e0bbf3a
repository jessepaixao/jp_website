I"a<p>I’m an engineering passionate about research and development of new technologies. I have a bachelor’s degree in mechanical engineering at São Paulo State University (UNESP). I did part of my undegraduate studies at Arts et Métiers Paristech in Paris. I obtained a master’s degree in solid mechanics at UNESP. I’m currently pursuing my PhD degree at University Bourgogne Franche-Comté in Besançon (France).</p>

<p>My professional experience in the industrial sector includes working at Corwave as an intern and R&amp;D engineer assistant in the development of a control device for an innovative implantable blood pump based on a breakthrough membrane technology. In the academic sector, I had the opportunity to carry out two R&amp;D internships in laboratories, the first at the ULHT (Lisbon, Portugal) and the second at CNU (Gwangju, South Korea).</p>

<p>I have interest in interdisciplinary problems in engineering, with special attention for the following topics: <strong>structural health monitoring, machine learning, additive manufacturing, uncertainty quantification, robust design</strong>.</p>
